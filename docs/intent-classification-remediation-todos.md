- [ ] **M3.3** Update UI to hide low-confidence predictions
  - File: `src/components/insights/IntentGraph.tsx`
  - Logic:
    ```typescript
    if (node.classification?.confidence < 0.6) {

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Ground-Truth Labeling is Expensive/Slow
**Mitigation:**
- Start with 500 samples (not 1,000) for faster iteration
- Use user feedback (M2) to supplement manual labeling
- Purchase existing labeled dataset if available

### Risk 2: Fine-Tuning Doesn't Improve Accuracy
**Mitigation:**
- Establish baseline (H2) before investing in fine-tuning
- Use prompt engineering improvements as alternative (cheaper, faster)
- Only fine-tune if zero-shot accuracy < 70%

### Risk 3: Users Don't Engage with Intent Features
**Mitigation:**
- Run A/B test (H3) before deep integration
- If test fails, pivot: Use intent internally (ranking) but don't expose to users
- Deprioritize or sunset feature if no value proven

### Risk 4: GDPR Violation Fines
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize C2 (user consent) immediately
- Do NOT enable training data collection until consent is live
- Legal review before any deployment
