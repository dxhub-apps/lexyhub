**Introducing LexyHub Extension: Keyword Research While You Browse**

We're thrilled to announce the launch of LexyHub Extension, a free browser extension that transforms the way you discover and track keywords for e-commerce.

**The Problem**

Traditional keyword research is tedious:
1. Open marketplace
2. Copy keyword
3. Switch to research tool
4. Paste and search
5. Record results
6. Repeat dozens of times

**The Solution**

LexyHub Extension integrates directly with your browser to highlight keywords from your watchlist as you browse. No more context switching. No more copy-paste. Just browse naturally and see insights in real-time.

**How It Works**

Install the extension, sign in with your LexyHub account, and start browsing Etsy, Amazon, or Shopify. Your watchlisted keywords are automatically highlighted. Hover over any keyword to see:

• Demand Index (search volume)
• Competition Score (saturation)
• AI Opportunity Score (our proprietary metric)
• Trend Direction (rising, falling, stable)
• Data Freshness

**Extension Boost**

As a bonus, installing the extension automatically upgrades your free plan limits:
• 25 searches/month (up from 10)
• 3 niches (up from 1)
• 8 AI opportunities (up from 2)

**Privacy First**

We only capture keyword terms—no personal data, no browsing history, no page content. Your privacy is our priority.

**Get Started**

Install LexyHub Extension today and experience keyword research reimagined.
